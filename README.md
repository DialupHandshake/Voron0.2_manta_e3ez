# Voron0.2_manta_e3ez
Configuration for Voron 0.2 printer with Bigtreetech Manta E3EZ board and CB1.
If you just need a config with pin mapping for Voron 0, grab btt_manta_e3ez_voron0_generic.cfg and rename it to printer.cfg. 
Otherwise feel free to use my printer.cfg.
If you are using CAN bus, there is a config for that in the CAN_bus_config folder.
