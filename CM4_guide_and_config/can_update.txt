# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH Manta E3EZ and BIGTREETECH EBB36 v1.2 running on CAN network.
# To use this config, compile the firmware with the following options:
# Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32) -- borth boards
# Processor model (STM32G0B1) -- borth boards (EBB36 v1.1 and 1.2 use STM32G0B1, and EBB36 v1.0 uses STM32F072. More details here: https://github.com/maz0r/klipper_canbus/blob/main/index.md)
# Clock Reference (8 MHz crystal) -- both boards
# Application start offset (8KiB offset) -- both boards
# (1000000) CAN bus speed -- both boards
# When building for Manta E3EZ, select "USB to CAN bus bridge on PA11/PA12" and "CAN bus (on PB12/PB13)"
# When building for EBB36 v1.2, select "CAN bus (on PB0/PB1)"

When installing OS on CM4, make sure to make use of the jumpers and CM toggle as per the Manta E3EZ manual.

Enable the USB hub on the Manta by navigating adding the line "dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host" to /boot/firmware/config.txt

Process of flashing the firmware for everything:

1. Use KIAUH to build the firmware for the Manta e3ez host and MCU first (settins above)
2. Install klipper on the host with KIAUH
3. Flash Klipper to MCU with KIAUH:
	Put the MCU into DFU mode by holding boot, pressing reset, and then releasing boot. 
	In KIAUH, go to Advanced, get MCU ID, and select option 3 (USB DFU mode). Make sure MCU is identified there.
	In KIAUH, go to Advanced, Flash Only, Regular flashing method, make flash, and select the MCU.
4. (only first time) Flash CanBoot to the EBB board via Katapult (canboot)
	Clone Katapult with "git clone https://github.com/Arksine/katapult"
	Build firmware with "cd katapult", "make menuconfig", "make" and use settings for EBB36 from top of this doc.
	Remove 120ohm jumper from EBB if present
	Add 5V jumper to EBB (pics here: https://maz0r.github.io/klipper_canbus/toolhead/ebb36-42_v1.1.html)
	Connect USB cable from Manta board to USB C on EBB board.
	Put the board into DFU mode by holding BOOT, pressing RESET, and releasing BOOT. lsusb should report "Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode"
	Flash canboot with this command: "sudo dfu-util -a 0 -D ~/katapult/out/canboot.bin --dfuse-address 0x08000000:force:mass-erase:leave -d 0483:df11". Errors may be reported.
	Reboot everything
5. Use KIAUH to build the firmware for the EBB36 board (settings above)
6. Flash Klipper to EBB36 via canboot
	Put the board into DFU mode same way as above (also quickly tapping RST may work)
	Make sure the device is up and on CAN network with "~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0". Should report "Found canbus_uuid=XXXXXXXXXX, Application: CanBoot"
	Flash the board with "python3 ~/CanBoot/scripts/flash_can.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u MYUUID"
	Reboot everything
	Verify that everything is ok by running "~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0". Should report "Found canbus_uuid=XXXXXXXXXX, Application: Klipper"
7. Log into mainsail and verify that evething has the same version of Klipper.
